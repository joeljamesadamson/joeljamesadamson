- 👋 Hi, I’m Joel J. Adamson @joeljamesadamson, fiction writer, statistician, sometime professor, mathematician, ex-scientist
- 👀 I’m interested in Emacs (been using Emacs as my main thing since 2005, sporadic usage before that going back to 1992) and to a lesser extent Scheme.  I prefer Scheme as a programming language but I just don't do that much programming on a daily basis.  I'm mostly using Emacs to write fiction.  If you use vi, I may still respect you as a human being.  Some of my friends use vi, but we try not to talk about it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to control myself
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Emacs, Scheme
- 📫 How to reach me: <joeljamesadamson@gmail.com>
- ⚡ Fun fact: why would any of the facts about me be fun?
